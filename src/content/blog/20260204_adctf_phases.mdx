This article is meant for people that want to improve their AD-CTF game by not just arriving on site and start to solve some challenges.
Playing AD-CTFs do have many more preparation steps and phases than jeopardy style competitions.
This article is written from a meta-gaming / infra perspective, so you should already have played at least one AD-CTF for this article to make sense.

### Basic model

Let's start with a simple model and work our way through what actually happens.

<Timeline>
  <TimelineEntry name={"Closed net"} color={"red"} width={25} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Main Game"} color={"green"} />
</Timeline>

The simplest version of an AD-CTF has two main phases over a duration of around 9 hours.
The game starts with a closed network, meaning that the participants only have access to their own machines.
There is no scoring yet and you cannot attack other teams.
This first phase is meant for reconnaissance and configuring your defenses.
It is the most stressful time for infra people, as they need to make sure traffic captures are running, access is working and first patches are applied.

Then the main game starts. The network is opened and attacks start rolling in.
You can also start attacking other teams if you have exploits yet.
Once the main game starts also the SLA bot will visit your services place flags and check your uptime.
You try to submit as many flags as possible and keep your services running until the end.

### Real model

The basic model is not actually describing what is happening.
Once you get access to the vulnbox there is critical phases that need to happen right at the start.
<Timeline>
  <TimelineText text={"Closed net"} with={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Access"} color={"orange"} width={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Recon"} color={"purple"} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Backups"} color={"yellow"} width={5} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Work distribution"} color={"pink"} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Patches"} color={"blue"} width={15} />
</Timeline>

The first step is clearly to get access to the vulnbox.
This is often done by a single person with only one job.
<i>Put SSH keys into the right places so everyone else can access the box.</i>

Once initial access is granted the reconnaissance phase starts.
The questions that should be answered here are:
* Where are the services located?
* What services are running?
* Which ports are open on the network?
* Is there weaknesses in the global vulnbox host configuration? (aka. is it possible for services to access each others files?)

With the information of the recon phase the infra team can start to make backups of the services.
Backups are critical. Some team member will break something, and then you need to be able to roll back a service.
If the vulnbox is hosted by the organizers, you might have access to a "reset" feature that will reset your complete vulnbox to the initial state.
This feature should only be a last resort.
If you use this you will have to apply all your changes again. This will lose you a lot of time.
So make sure you can restore each service to the initial state individually.

The work distribution phase is probably the most important phase.
You need to communicate as a team and decide who is doing what.
This can be prepared in advance, but concrete work packets for each person will only be clear at this stage.
The last part of the closed network phase is to apply hardening for the services and patch vulnerabilities that have already been found.

<Timeline>
  <TimelineText text={"Main Game"} width={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Scoring start"} color={"yellow"} width={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Solving"} color={"purple"} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"End"} color={"blue"} width={10} />
</Timeline>

The start of the main game means that the network opens and the score-bot starts visiting your services.
Check if you services are actually up and your initial patches did not break anything.
You will have flags in your services and therefore something to lose.
Find out where the flags are located in the services and finish your exploits according to the locations.
On the other hand, other teams will start to attack you, so you should keep an eye on the network traffic and check for incoming attacks.

The solving phase is the longest phase of the game.
You will bash your head against the service code and try to find vulnarbilities and write exploits for them.
At some stage a team will find a vulnerability in the service and will attack you.
Use your traffic sniffing setup to find these attacks and try to understand what is going on.
If you cannot figure out how the attack works, at least filter the traffic patterns on the network layer so you are losing fewer flags.

The end phase is a sub phase of the solving phase.
As the game starts to get closer to the end, the team will become less focused and the productivity will drop.
Many players are not willing to start work on a new service or exploit as they know that time is running out.
Therefore, they will start to refresh the scoreboard and check how many opponents can be overtaken with the current point velocity.
On the other hand, there are still players that fight for every last flag by manually attacking teams or trying to finish that last exploit in the last second.
This last phase is more an organizational challenge than a technical one.
All systems should be running smoothly by now, so infra people can focus on which data should be backed up after the CTF.


### The extended model

Understanding the basic phases during an AD-CTF is important.
However, these are by far not the only phases you will encounter.
How your team members think about the time apart from the official game phases will decide if you are a competitive or casual CTF team.

<Timeline>
  <TimelineEntry name={"No CTF"} color={"gray"} width={10} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"CTF Prep"} color={"blue"} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Day-of Prep"} color={"orange"} width={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Official CTF"} color={"green"} width={15} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Party"} color={"purple"} width={"shrink"} />
  <TimelineEntry name={"Post-CTF"} color={"red"} width={20} />
</Timeline>

In the extended model we look at all the phases that build up around the official CTF-start and -end.
The first phase is the "No CTF" phase. In this phase there is no AD-CTF planned, so there is no real stress on the team.
However, once a CTF is announced and the team decides to participate, the "CTF Prep" phase starts.
In this phase the team will decide on a specific tool stack to use during the AD-CTF, and might develop tools to be used during the CTF.
This phase should actually be split into two sub-phases.
After a first phase, where you explore different tools you should have a "tool freeze" phase and after that point in time you make sure that the tools work well and everyone is trained.
Do not add tools shortly before the CTF, as this will only lead to confusion and problems.

The "Day-of Prep" phase is the time right before the official CTF starts.
This happens on the same day as the CTF and includes:
* Traveling to the CTF location
* Setting up your infra
* Starting your laptops and connecting to VPNs
* Spreading CTF team internal information like IP addresses, usernames and passwords
* Making sure that there is enough snacks

This phase is often underestimated and causes a lot of stress.
If the infra is not tested well you will have problems here.
Do not depend on the CTF organizers to start late and give you more time to set up your infra.
Once you have access to the vulnboxes all preparations should be done so you can focus completely on the tasks described for the "Closed net" phase.

After the official CTF is over, everyone packs up their stuff.
You should have a beer or two with your teammates and celebrate the end of the CTF.
A CTF is a lot of work and causes stress. This phase is important to bring back down the stress levels.
The infra team will join the party a bit later as they still have to stop and back up the infra.
Discuss stuff you have encountered with your teammates and enjoy the time together.

However, do not forget that there is still the "Post-CTF" phase.
This phase starts the day after the CTF.
In this phase you should think about what went well and what went wrong during the CTF.
This is something you should document so you can improve for the next CTF.
Write a blog post, create writeups for challenges you solved and share your experiences with the community.
If you had problems with your infra, try to fix them for the next CTF.
Good teams will continuously improve their setup and processes.

### Where all models break down

Well. Now we discussed a very detailed model of how AD-CTFs work.
Actually, they are even more chaotic than described.
You will encounter teammates arriving late, and asking how to access the vulnbox way into the main game.
You will have uptime issues that will involve infra people and changing out infra mid-game.
Organizers will add additional phases like scoreboard freezes.
Maybe the orga infra has issues, delaying the main game start.
Next to all technical issues, there are also human issues.
There will be surprises, curveballs and unexpected events.
So try to stay calm, communicate well and adapt to each situation as it unfolds.
